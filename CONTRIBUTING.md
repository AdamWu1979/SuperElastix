## Coding conventions ##

* Adhere to style in the same file

* Separate STYLE commits from functional changes. STYLE commits don't need much attention from others, functional changes do.

* Some IDEs tend to apply their own coding style. This introduces unwanted STYLE changes if code-blocks are copy-pasted. Please turn off this feature.

* Preferably, use commit messages tags: ENH, BUG, COMP, PERF, STYLE. 

### Suggested ###

* In general we adhere to a style similar to [elastix style](https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [itk style](https://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ITK/Coding_Style_Guide) 

Thanks,
